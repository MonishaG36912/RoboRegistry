## Core Implementation Summary

### Robot Registry Management System
The system serves as the central controller for robot collection, managing both concrete `HumanoidRobot` objects and polymorphic `Robot` types. It implements:
- Dynamic array with automatic expansion (`growArray()`)
- Comprehensive display formatting with automatically calculated column widths
- Dual storage systems (concrete objects and polymorphic pointers)

### HumanoidRobot Class
A composition-based implementation containing:
- Core identifiers (company, name, version)
- Validated price field
- Optional `RobotComponent` (composition pattern)

Implements advanced C++ features:
- Move semantics (constructor + assignment)
- String conversion operator
- Formatted output streaming

### Polymorphic Robot Hierarchy
Built on an abstract `Robot` base class with three specialized implementations:

1. **MilitaryRobot**:
   - Mission-specific functionality
   - Weapon power and stealth capabilities
   - Special combat methods (`fireWeapon()`)

2. **IndustrialRobot**:
   - Factory location tracking
   - Work capacity metrics
   - CSV parsing constructor

3. **DomesticRobot**:
   - Household task specialization
   - Dual-version input operator (basic/performance)

### Key Features Implemented
- **Memory Management**:
  - RAII principles for resource safety
  - Proper cleanup in destructors
  - Move semantics for efficient transfers

- **Input Validation**:
  - Functor-based validators (`PriceValidator`, `StringValidator`)
  - Robust user input handling

- **File I/O**:
  - Loading robot data from formatted text files
  - Output redirection capability

- **Analysis Tools**:
  - Price statistics (min/max/mean)
  - Filtering by price threshold
  - Polymorphic behavior demonstration

### Advanced C++ Techniques
- Polymorphism through virtual functions
- Move semantics for efficient object transfer
- Functors for validation strategies
- Lambda expressions for filters
- Operator overloading (`<<`, string conversion)
- Dynamic memory management with ownership semantics
